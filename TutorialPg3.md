GitHub allows you to publish your page to the internet, hosted through GitHub. To do this, the repository you wish to publish must be set to "Public".
First, enter the repository you wish to publish, and navigate to "Settings" near the top center. ![Screenshot (123)](https://github.com/BDBluhm/INFOTC-1600-Final/assets/116319535/dd0a122f-105d-46f3-9b18-347e4cafad25)

In settings, look to the left for the "Code and Automation" segment, and select "Pages".

Select "Configure" under GitHub Pages Jekyll, and commit the changes. This will create the "workflows" folder and the Jekyll program automatically.

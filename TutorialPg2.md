## Creating and Editing Files
At this screen there are a lot of options. At the moment you can create a new file with the "Add File" button, edit the README by hitting the pencil icon, and create or view your branches. For a solo project, you likely won't need to touch the branches feature, but branches are useful for managing your code while working in a group.

Most projects will begin in the README, which serves as the information hub and the root page of your project. If you publish your project as a GitHub Pages website, by default it will use the root of the main branch as it's default page, which is your README.md file. For an html site this root will be named index.html.

But projects will grow quickly, and you will want to add new files. Click the "Add File" button and it will navigate towards this page, the editing bay of that new file.

Give your page an appropriate name, write your content in it's text box, and when you'd like to save your progress hit the green "Commit changes" button near the top right. You will see this pop up.

This box gives you the opportunity to commit these changes to a new branch. This would allow you or your team members to review changes made, or explore different design avenues without saving over previously established work. Very useful for group work, but for a solo project its safe to commit your changes to the main branch.

##Creating and Editing Files
At this screen there are a lot of options. At the moment you can create a new file with the "Add File" button, edit the README by hitting the pencil icon, and create or view your branches. For a solo project, you likely won't need to touch the branches feature, but branches are useful for managing your code while working in a group.
